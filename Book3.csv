Ferdinand Bolstraat 194 Oud Zuid 1072 LW Amsterdam Netherlands,114,10/25/2016,6.4,Savoy Hotel Amsterdam, Iceland , This hotel is rated as 4 star but should be 2 star or less Terrible choice and I feel some part deceived as I paid somewhere north of EUR 180 for the night there I do not recommend this hotel Here are some points 1 My room was not clean or at least it felt and looked unclean There were coins on the floor when I arrived and they stayed there the whole trip 2 Towels in the bathroom had dirt spots on them they were also worn and torn The bathroom had a large window in the shower towards the street and beneath the window there was a rusty radiator it did not add to the hygiene level of the room 3 Lights were hanging loose on the fasteners above the bed I was just waiting to get them falling in my head 4 The air condition unit started some loud drumming at 100 decibels or could be even more in the mid night Not able to sleep I complained but the hotel was fully booked and nothing the staff could do When the radiator finally got quiet I ensured it was off for the rest of the stay 5 The bed was a foam rubber mattress far too soft for any regular sized 80 kg weight man to sleep in 6 There was not an option to ask for privacy as no placards signs were available to hang on the door 7 No coffee or any beverages available in the room 8 The TV had only regular TV broadcast stations in bad quality with bad pixels no cable or any HD broadcasting not that I would have enjoyed it in the soft foam mattress bed in the unclean room This hotel is rated as 4 star but that is extremely overrated in my opinion Should be closer to 2 star or even less ,317,995,No Positive,0,2,"[' Business trip ', ' Solo traveler ', ' Twin Room ', ' Stayed 3 nights ']",282 day,52.3497431,4.8911908,Low_Reviewer_Score

Via Angelo Carlo Fumagalli 4 Navigli 20143 Milan Italy,199,11/11/2015,8.6,Art Hotel Navigli, South Africa , Have to say this has been the worst experience that I ve ever had in Milan Given that I travel to Milan every year on business and have stayed in many 4 star hotel this rates poorly The reason been that I booked a non smoking room and then was move to a smaller room which clearly was for one person On complaining my complaints were not directed to someone in charge and if they were then the person in question didn t have the gumption or the manners to speak to me directly shocking My request was that I was not prepared to move again and that the rate should be reduced this was to no avail So you have my vote of 0 and I will make sure this is heard ,135,3636, Nothing ,3,2,"[' Business trip ', ' Couple ', ' Superior Double Room ', ' Stayed 6 nights ']",631 day,45.4501306,9.1696481,Low_Reviewer_Score
